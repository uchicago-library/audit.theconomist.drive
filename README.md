# Introduction

This is a project for the Electronic Resources Management Librarian. An external hard drive containing image files, xml records, files with the .tbl file extension, and DTD files was received.

## The Problem

There were approximately 876 GB of files and disk corruption of the external drive occurred.  I  volunteered to the stakeholder to run an audit of the files and return a list of the corrupted files. 

## The result 

There were a total of 592,526 jpeg files and 198,230 are corrupted. That’s a 33% error rate.

There were 17029 xml files and 6,039 could not be opened.  That’s a 35% error rate.

The .tbl files and the dtd files appeared to be uncorrupted.
